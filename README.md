# Odin-Admin-Dashboard

## Overview

The Admin Dashboard is the final project from the Intermediate HTML and CSS course from the Odin Project. 

The main purpose of this project is to use the grid layout tools that were covered in the previous lessons. Therefore, I have only used grid in the layout.

We were provided an example layout, which I have tried to stick to, with changes made to the icons and color scheme.

### Provided Example Layout
